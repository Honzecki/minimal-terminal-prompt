## Installation

Clone and cd into the repo, then just copy the desired PS1 .sh file contents into your  `~/.bashrc`
```
cat minimal-terminal-prompt.sh  >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then reload the new updated profile, either by restarting your terminal, or by running:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

Done ðŸ˜Ž

_(**Note (for Mac OS X):** Because by default OS X starts a login session first,
the file `~/.bash_profile` can be used in place of  `~/.bashrc`. Read more about this on this
[GNU Documentation Article](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html). )_
